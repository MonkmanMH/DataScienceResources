Usually seen in the context of management accounting, ABC is a method that measures the cost and volume of inputs required to produce a fixed amount of output.

## Gini coefficient

From the wikipedia entry:

>The Gini coefficient (also known as the Gini index or Gini ratio) is a measure of statistical dispersion intended to represent the income distribution of a nation's residents, and is the most commonly used measure of inequality. It was developed by the Italian statistician and sociologist Corrado Gini and published in his 1912 paper "Variability and Mutability" (Italian: Variabilità e mutabilità).
>
>The Gini coefficient measures the inequality among values of a frequency distribution (for example, levels of income). A Gini coefficient of zero expresses perfect equality, where all values are the same (for example, where everyone has the same income). A Gini coefficient of 1 (or 100%) expresses maximal inequality among values (e.g., for a large number of people, where only one person has all the income or consumption, and all others have none, the Gini coefficient will be very nearly one).

## Imputation of missing data (or missing values)

Missing data can pose a challenge for a data analysis, and can limit or compromise the models and conclusions that can be drawn.

One method of dealing with missing data is through imputation.

> ** The Problem of the Random Walk **

> Can any of your readers refer me to a work wherein I should find a solution of the following problem, or failing the knowledge of any existing solution provide me with an original one? I should be extremely grateful for aid in the matter.

> A man starts from a point O and walks _l_ yards in a straight line; he then turns at any angle whatever and walks another _l_ yards in a second straight line. he repeats this process _n_ times. I require the probability that after these _n_ stretches he is at a distance between _r_ and _r + delta-r_ from his starting point, O.

> The problem is one of considerable interest, but I have only succeeded in obtaining an integrated solution for _two_ stretches. I think, however, that a solution ought to be found, if only in the form of a series in powers of 1/_n_, where _n_ is large.

## Seasonal adjustment

From the wikipedia entry:

>Seasonal adjustment is a statistical method for removing the seasonal component of a time series that exhibits a seasonal pattern. It is usually done when wanting to analyse the trend of a time series independently of the seasonal components. It is normal to report seasonally adjusted data for unemployment rates to reveal the underlying trends in labor markets. Many economic phenomena have seasonal cycles, such as agricultural production and consumer consumption, e.g. greater consumption leading up to Christmas. It is necessary to adjust for this component in order to understand what underlying trends are in the economy and so official statistics are often adjusted to remove seasonal components.

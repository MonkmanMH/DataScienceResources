# Statistical & Data Science Practice {#practice}



First, an excellent list of data science resources:

* [Practical Data Science for Stats - a PeerJ Collection](https://peerj.com/collections/50-practicaldatascistats/)


## Introduction

How does one approach a statistics or data science project?


### A theory of data analysis

### The function of data science: solving business problems

Emily Robinson, 2017-09-27, [Managing Business Challenges In Data Science](https://robinsones.github.io/Managing-Business-Challenges-in-Data-Science/)


### Design thinking >> data science context

Roger Peng, 2019-01-09, [How Data Scientists Think - A Mini Case Study](https://simplystatistics.org/2019/01/09/how-data-scientists-think-a-mini-case-study/)



### Opinionated Analysis Development

An over-arching structure of what a project could (or should?) look like can be boiled down into three features: it is

1. Reproducible and auditable

2. Accurate

3. Collaborative


Hilary Parker, 2017-08-30, [Opinionated Analysis Development](https://peerj.com/preprints/3210/)

- some of Hilary Parker's earlier / supporting thoughts on this topic can be found in [her talk "Opinionated Analysis Development" from rstudio::conf2017 (2017-01-14)](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/videos/opinionated-analysis-development/) ([slides alone at slideshare](https://www.slideshare.net/hilaryparker/opinionated-analysis-development)), as well as the slides from her [keynote at EARL SF (2017-06-15)](https://www.slideshare.net/hilaryparker/opinionated-analysis-development-earl-sf-keynote)

## R-specific workflow

### Agile

Edwin Thoen, [Agile Data Science with R](https://edwinth.github.io/ADSwR/)


### other

Gabe Becker (2017) [Enhancing reproducibility, comparability and discoverability of results in multi-analyst settings](https://www.slideshare.net/GabrielBecker11/enhancing-reproducibility-comparability-and-discoverability-of-results-in-multianalyst-settings), presentation at EARL (Enterprise Applications of R Language), San Francisco, June 5-7, 2017

* this came to my attention via the Not So Standard Deviations podcast, [episode 40 "It's the CDs All Over Again"](https://www.patreon.com/posts/episode-40-its-11713845) (2017-06-13). The discussion of Gabe Becker's presentation begins at ~13' 10".
  
  - some of Hilary Parker's observations: the topic doesn't get much air time, his talk takes wide view of issues in an organization, trade-offs in collaborative environment (not one analyst); in multi-analyst system (e.g. where both a researcher/biologist and a statistician are both working with the same data) have to reconcile results, there might be parallel studies where results need to be reconciled, >> this creates a need for the data to be created in similar environments. 
  
  - Concerns: reproducibity, comparability,  discoverability (finding the results), and empowerment. Data scientists skew to emppowerment!  But the concerns are in tension--you can increase reproducibility but at cost of empowerment, etc.
  
  - "Most organizations aren't making that judgement call ahead of time...any organization ... if data scientists were there early, you're going to be skewed to agility and high empowerment. Because that's like what we want! ... Data scientists are allergic to process...having any template for results, or ... even having to put things into a specific tool."
  
  - Different systems need different constraints.
  
  - Roger Peng: most organizations don't realize that they are explicitly making these trade-offs, can't maximize all. Have to make a choice, and that's very unsatisfactory for people.

## R packages supporting robust workflow

[**R project workflows**](https://github.com/jdblischak/r-project-workflows#readme): a GitHub repository compiled by jdblichak

* "This is a non-exhaustive list of R code that assists with the workflow of R projects. Some are R packages, others are Git repositories meant to be used as templates, and some are guides. Here "workflow" is broadly defined, and incldues one or more of the following: file organization, dependency management (e.g. like GNU Make), or report generation."


### `{drake}`

CRAN: [drake: A Pipeline Toolkit for Reproducible Computation at Scale](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=drake) -- "A general-purpose computational engine for data analysis, drake rebuilds intermediate data objects when their dependencies change, and it skips work when the results are already up to date. Not every execution starts from scratch, there is native support for parallel and distributed computing, and completed projects have tangible evidence that they are reproducible. Extensive documentation, from beginner-friendly tutorials to practical examples and more, is available at the reference website <https://docs.ropensci.org/drake/> and the online manual <https://books.ropensci.org/drake/>."

### `{janitor}`

[{janitor}](sfirke.github.io/janitor/index.html) -- "has simple functions for examining and cleaning dirty data. It was built with beginning and intermediate R users in mind and is optimized for user-friendliness. Advanced R users can already do everything covered here, but with janitor they can do it faster and save their thinking for the fun stuff."

CRAN: [usethis: Automate Package and Project Setup](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=usethis) -- "Automate package and project setup tasks that are otherwise performed manually.

### Literate programming

The practice of explaining the program logic in a natural language"; it goes beyond what might be called "documentation". In the world of R, the RMarkdown functionality within [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/), including [R notebooks](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/r_notebooks.html), is a way to program in this manner.

The concept was introduced by Donald Knuth in 1984; the original article is

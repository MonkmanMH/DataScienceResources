# Data Cleaning and Validation {#datacleaning}



## Introduction

Data scientists, by some accounts, spend 80% of their time cleaning data. Ensuring that your data is of high quality ensures that your analysis, and thus your conclusions, are also of high quality, is an essential step in the data science process.

### `{validate}`

CRAN: [validate: Data Validation Infrastructure](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/validate/) -- "Declare data validation rules and data quality indicators; confront data with them and analyze or visualize the results. The package supports rules that are per-field, in-record, cross-record or cross-dataset. Rules can be automatically analyzed for rule type and connectivity."

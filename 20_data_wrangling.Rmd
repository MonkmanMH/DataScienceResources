# Data Wrangling (emphasis on tidy data) {#datawrangling}

> If 80% of the data scientist's job is data cleaning, perhaps that _is_ the job. (Source: Anon.)


## Introduction

Data is rarely in condition to use it...there's invariably something amiss.  Data wrangling (a.k.a. data carpentry) is the process of getting it ready for analysis.

And all too often, data are messy. There are rows with no contents, colour-coded cells, and inconsistent values.

One important way that data can be cleaned is to ensure that the structure is tidy. What do we mean by tidy data?

> There are three interrelated rules which make a dataset tidy:
> * Each variable must have its own column.
> * Each observation must have its own row.
> * Each value must have its own cell.

And 

> Why ensure that your data is tidy? There are two main advantages:
> 
> 1. There‚Äôs a general advantage to picking one consistent way of storing data. If you have a consistent data structure, it‚Äôs easier to learn the tools that work with it because they have an underlying uniformity.
>
> 2. There‚Äôs a specific advantage to placing variables in columns because it allows R‚Äôs vectorised nature to shine. As you learned in mutate and summary functions, most built-in R functions work with vectors of values. That makes transforming tidy data feel particularly natural.

(from [@Wickham_Grolemund2016])


This won't solve things like inconsistent values and colour-coded cells, but it will solve some other messiness.

For more about the principles of tidy data, see Hadley Wickham's article "Tidy data", in _The Journal of Statistical Software_ [@tidydata]

### Tidy text

If  you're going to undertake text mining and natural language processing, your text (i.e. your data) needs to be tidy.  Fortunately, there's an R package for that: `tidytext`.

See the companion chapter on the topics of [Text Analysis and Text Mining].

# Data science pedagogy & andragogy 

## Introduction

Since it's a relatively new field, it's not surprising that the best way to teach data science is still evolving. Below are some resources for those who are sorting out how to teach this cross-silo discipline.

Advice for new lecturers:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Interview went well yesterday, thanks for all the messages of support. My favourite question... You are talking to a new lecturer and they are asking for advice. What are 3 pieces of advice you would give them about teaching? thread 1/4</p>&mdash; Dr Jenny Richmond (@JenRichmondPhD) <a href="https://twitter.com/JenRichmondPhD/status/1154197750243741696?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 25, 2019</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> 

and a reply:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">These are good. I would add:<br>- Not every lecture will go well. Learn from the bad ones but donâ€™t obsess over them. <br>- Teaching is a gas and expands to fill available space.

## Andragogy

> Andragogy: the method and practice of teaching adult learners; adult education.


Knowles developed four principles of andragogy:

1. **Involved adult learners**  -- learners need to be involved in the planning and evaluation of their instruction

2. **Experience** (including mistakes) provides the basis for the learning activities

3. **Relevance and impact** -- adults are most interested in learning subjects that have immediate relevance and impact to their job or personal life

4. **Problem centred** rather than content-centred

(adapted from https://knowlestheories.weebly.com/principles-of-andragogy.html)


Malcolm S. Knowles, [_The Modern Practice of Adult Education_](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/8948/296248bbf58415cbd21b36a3e4b37b9c08b1.pdf) -- chapter 4, "What is Andragogy?"

## Teaching R

Wisdom from Roger Peng:

> You have to decide how to teach this topic...you have to decide how to present this material, and in what order. 
> Are you teaching people how to analyze data, or are you teaching people a programming language?

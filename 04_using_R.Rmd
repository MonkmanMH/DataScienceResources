# Using R 



## Introduction

In addition to there being many resources available for using R to solve statistical and data science challenges, there are also many resources on how to maximize your effectiveness using R.

This chapter compiles what I consider to be the essential texts; articles and blog posts will be at a minimum.


## General & all-encompassing resources

## The tidyverse

All too often, data are messy. There are rows with no contents, colour-coded cells, and inconsistent values.

One important way that data can be cleaned is to ensure that the structure is tidy. What do we mean by tidy data?

> There are three interrelated rules which make a dataset tidy:
> * Each variable must have its own column.
> * Each observation must have its own row.
> * Each value must have its own cell.

And 

> Why ensure that your data is tidy? There are two main advantages:
> 
> 1. There’s a general advantage to picking one consistent way of storing data. If you have a consistent data structure, it’s easier to learn the tools that work with it because they have an underlying uniformity.
>
> 2. There’s a specific advantage to placing variables in columns because it allows R’s vectorised nature to shine. As you learned in mutate and summary functions, most built-in R functions work with vectors of values. That makes transforming tidy data feel particularly natural.

(from [@Wickham_Grolemund2016])


This won't solve things like inconsistent values and colour-coded cells, but it will solve some other messiness.

#### Tidy text

If  you're going to undertake text mining and natural language processing, your text (i.e. your data) needs to be tidy.  Fortunately, there's an R package for that: `tidytext`.

See the companion chapter on the topics of [Text Analysis and Text Mining].

# Using R 



## Introduction

In addition to there being many resources available for using R to solve statistical and data science challenges, there are also many resources on how to maximize your effectiveness using R.

This chapter compiles what I consider to be the essential texts; articles and blog posts will be at a minimum.

## The R community

[The R Consortium](https://www.r-consortium.org/) " is a group organized under an open source governance and foundation model to support the worldwide community of users, maintainers and developers of R software. ... The central mission of the R Consortium is to work with and provide support to the R Foundation and key organizations and groups developing, maintaining, distributing and using R software."

[The R Foundation](https://www.r-project.org/foundation/) 

>is a not for profit organization working in the public interest. It has been founded by the members of the R Development Core Team in order to
>* Provide support for the R project and other innovations in statistical computing. We believe that R has become a mature and valuable tool and we would like to ensure its continued development and the development of future innovations in software for statistical and computational research.
>* Provide a reference point for individuals, instititutions or commercial enterprises that want to support or interact with the R development community.
>* Hold and administer the copyright of R software and documentation.

## General & all-encompassing resources


David Smale, [Free R Reading Material](https://committedtotape.shinyapps.io/freeR/),  A Shiny app collection "of books about the R programming language and Data Science, that you can read for free!"


Jennifer Bryan and Jim Hester, [What They Forgot to Teach You About R](https://whattheyforgot.org/) -- "designed for experienced R and RStudio users who want to (re)design their R lifestyle. We focus on building holistic and project-oriented workflows that address the most common sources of friction in data analysis, _outside of doing the statistical analysis itself_."

Colin Fay, 2018-09-24, [Why do we use arrow as an assignment operator?](https://colinfay.me/r-assignment/) -- answering the second-most-asked question about R.


### Journals

[The R Journal](https://journal.r-project.org/archive/)—"the open access, refereed journal of the R project for statistical computing. It features short to medium length articles covering topics that should be of interest to users or developers of R."


[Journal of Statistical Software](https://www.jstatsoft.org/index)—not limited to R, the journal "publishes articles, book reviews, code snippets, and software reviews on the subject of statistical software and algorithms."


### Text books by subject

Jacob Kaplan (2020-01-15) [_Crime by the Numbers_](https://crimebythenumbers.com/)—"This book introduces the programming language R and is meant for undergrads or graduate students studying criminology. R is a programming language that is well-suited to the type of work frequently done in criminology - taking messy data and turning it into useful information. While R is a useful tool for many fields of study, this book focuses on the skills criminologists should know and uses crime data for the example data sets."

## The R toolbox

### CRAN

[The Comprehensive R Archive Network](https://cran.r-project.org/) -- CRAN for short -- "is a network of ftp and web servers around the world that store identical, up-to-date, versions of code and documentation for R." This is the place to get your installation of R, and the production versions of your favourite packages.

### RStudio -- the IDE

"RStudio" can mean one of two things:

* [the integrated development environment (IDE) for R](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/)

* [the company](https://www.rstudio.com/) which makes the IDE, as well as enterprise software and a variety of packages

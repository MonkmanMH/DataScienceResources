# Using R 



## Introduction

In addition to there being many resources available for using R to solve statistical and data science challenges, there are also many resources on how to maximize your effectiveness using R.

This chapter compiles what I consider to be the essential texts; articles and blog posts will be at a minimum.


## General & all-encompassing resources

David Smale, [Free R Reading Material](https://committedtotape.shinyapps.io/freeR/),  A Shiny app collection "of books about the R programming language and Data Science, that you can read for free!"


Jennifer Bryan and Jim Hester, [What They Forgot to Teach You About R](https://whattheyforgot.org/) -- "designed for experienced R and RStudio users who want to (re)design their R lifestyle. We focus on building holistic and project-oriented workflows that address the most common sources of friction in data analysis, _outside of doing the statistical analysis itself_."

Colin Fay, 2018-09-24, [Why do we use arrow as an assignment operator?](https://colinfay.me/r-assignment/) -- answering the second-most-asked question about R.


### R Release Names

The most-asked question about R. 

Answer: "All of the release names are references to Peanuts strips/films."

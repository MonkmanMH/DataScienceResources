# (PART) Data Visualization {-} 


# General {#datavisualization}


## Introduction

This is an _enormous_ topic. 

But start here: 

* Alberto Cairo, _The Functional Art_ [@Cairo_2013] and _The Truthful Art_ [@Cairo_2016] are framed in the context of Cairo's professional expertise in "data journalism".

* William S. Cleveland's books, _Visualizing Data_ [@Cleveland_1993] and _The Elements of Graphing Data_ [@Cleveland_1994], are classics in the field of statistical graphics.

* Kennedy Elliot, [Everything we know about how humans interpret graphics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0J6EDvlN30), video of talk given at OpenVis conference, 2016-04-25 & 26.

* Elijah Meeks, ["What Charts Do"](https://medium.com/@Elijah_Meeks/what-charts-do-48ed96f70a74) (2018-05-21) is a succinct summary that's worth reading.

* Cole Nussbaumer Knaflic, _Storytelling with Data_ [@NussbaumerKnaflic_2015]. A great introduction to the fundamentals of good visualization. The [companion blog](https://www.storytellingwithdata.com/) has an on-going series of further dives into the topic.

* Naomi Robbins, _Creating More Effective Graphs_. [@Robbins_2013]

* Alan Smith, ["Data visualisation: it is not all about technology"](https://www.ft.com/content/aba6c58e-5a8e-11e7-9bc8-8055f264aa8b?accessToken=zwAAAVz0i_FYkdOrpsWOWo4R59ObyIBV8mSqiw.MEQCIFBdm394GSC6W-YIMME93SN8BgAuLEfyK8nFshbAiyu-AiBx6Qx4Ivd3qh-VSfIlwrf5tYKdnbGId1n0pzxZFUwDsQ&sharetype=gift), _Financial Times_, 2017-06-28

* John W. Tukey, _Exploratory Data Analysis_ [@Tukey_1977] is a classic--it might seem dated with its heavy reliance on analogue methods (for example, the suggestions about graph paper (p.127)), but the concepts are timeless.

## R Resources

### general

* [R Graph Catalog](http://shiny.stat.ubc.ca/r-graph-catalog/) -- an unbeatable resource for making good graphs in R, described by the creators as "a complement to _Creating More Effective Graphs_ by Naomi Robbins."  [@Robbins_2013]

* Michael Friendly and David Meyer (2016) _Discrete Data Analysis with R_ [@Friendly_Meyer_2016]

## **ggplot2** -- the pre-eminent way to create charts and graphs in R

* [**ggplot2**: part of the tidyverse](http://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/index.html) -- reference materials, examples, etc etc. Start here.

* [Top 50 **ggplot2** Visualizations - The Master List (With Full R Code)](http://r-statistics.co/Top50-Ggplot2-Visualizations-MasterList-R-Code.html)

* [A Compendium of Clean Graphs in R](http://shinyapps.org/apps/RGraphCompendium/index.php), by Eric-Jan Wagenmakers and Quentin F. Gronau

* [BBC Visual and Data Journalism cookbook for R graphics](https://bbc.github.io/rcookbook/)

   - [**bbplot**](https://github.com/bbc/bbplot), a package with their templates etc.

### extensions

There are many extension packages that allow you to make other visualizations in **ggplot2**. Some are catalogued at [www.ggplot2-exts.org](https://www.ggplot2-exts.org/index.html).

* Gallery of **ggplot2** extensions: [ggplot2-exts.org/gallery/](ggplot2 extensions - gallery )

** _Note:_**



### Plotly

Plotly for R allows you to "Create interactive, D3 and WebGL charts in R" (their words, not mine). A great resource for upping the content of online visualizations.

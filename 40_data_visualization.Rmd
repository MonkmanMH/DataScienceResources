## Introduction

This is an _enormous_ topic. 

But start here:

* Cole Nussbaumer Knaflic, [_Storytelling with Data_] (Wiley). A great introduction to the fundamentals of good visualization. The [companion blog](https://www.storytellingwithdata.com/) has is an on-going series of further dives into the topic.

* Elijah Meeks, ["What Charts Do"](https://medium.com/@Elijah_Meeks/what-charts-do-48ed96f70a74), 2018-05-21

* Claus O. Wilke (2019, full draft) [_Fundamentals of Data Visualization_](http://serialmentor.com/dataviz/)

  - Note that Wilke notes that this is a platform-agnostic book, but it was written in R's `bookdown` and uses `ggplot2` for all of the figures.

## R Resources

### general

* [R Graph Catalog](http://shiny.stat.ubc.ca/r-graph-catalog/) -- an unbeatable resource for making good graphs in R, described by the creators as "a complement to _Creating More Effective Graphs_ by Naomi Robbins." 

* [Shiny apps for statistics](https://statistics.calpoly.edu/shiny) -- by the Statistics Department at CalPoly

* Kieran Healy, [_Data Visualization for Social Science_](http://socviz.co/)

* [R color cheatsheet](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/~frazier/RSpatialGuides/colorPaletteCheatsheet.pdf)



### ggplot2 -- the pre-eminent way to create charts and graphs in R

* [ggplot2: part of the tidyverse](http://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/index.html) -- reference materials, examples, etc etc. Start here.

* [Top 50 ggplot2 Visualizations - The Master List (With Full R Code)](http://r-statistics.co/Top50-Ggplot2-Visualizations-MasterList-R-Code.html)

* [A Compendium of Clean Graphs in R](http://shinyapps.org/apps/RGraphCompendium/index.php), by Eric-Jan Wagenmakers and Quentin F. Gronau

* [BBC Visual and Data Journalism cookbook for R graphics](https://bbc.github.io/rcookbook/)

   - [`bbplot`](https://github.com/bbc/bbplot), a package with their templates etc.
   
   - ["How the BBC Visual and Data Journalism team works with graphics in R"](https://medium.com/bbc-visual-and-data-journalism/how-the-bbc-visual-and-data-journalism-team-works-with-graphics-in-r-ed0b35693535)


#### extensions

#### tips and tricks

* Laura Ellis, 2018-08-01, [Highlighting with ggplot2: The Old School and New School Way](https://www.littlemissdata.com/blog/highlight)


** _Note:_**

There are many extension packages that allow you to make other visualizaitons in `ggplot2`; they are referenced below.


### Plotly

Plotly for R allows you to "Create interactive, D3 and WebGL charts in R" (their words, not mine). A great resource for upping the content of online visualizations.

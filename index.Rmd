# Preface {-}

_Draft, version 2_

This book grew out of my evergrowing collection of reference materials that was saved as an expanding array of markdown files in a github repo. By assembling it as a book, I hope that it will be more accessible and useful to other R users.

**Cover image**

For the cover, I wanted to use a photo of the Main Hall of the old Cincinnati Library, which one can find all over the internet. But going to source, I see that it's _not_ offered by the Public Library of Cincinnati under an open license. But you can follow [this link and see it there](https://www.flickr.com/photos/cincinnatipubliclibrary/3357891281).


This book is written in **Markdown**, using the **bookdown** package.


```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("bookdown")
# or the development version
# devtools::install_github("rstudio/bookdown")
```

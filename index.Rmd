_Draft_

This book grew out of my evergrowing collection of reference materials that was saved as an expanding array of markdown files in a github repo. By assembling it as a book, I hope that it will be more accessible and useful to other R users.

**Source code**

The source code for this ebook can be found at this github repository: https://github.com/MonkmanMH/DataScienceResources 

This book is written in **Markdown**, using the [**bookdown**](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/) package, and published to the web at [bookdown.org](https://bookdown.org/).



**Cover image**

The cover image is the [historiated initial R from the frontispiece of a 12th-century manuscript of St. Gregory's _Moralia in Job_, Dijon, Bibl. Municipale, MS 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%C3%AEteaux_Moralia_in_Job). The manuscript was made at the famous reform monastery of CÃ®teaux in Burgundy around 1111; the frontispiece was added later.

It was downloaded from [wikipedia commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Moralia_in_Job_MS_dragonslayer.jpg); that site notes that the image is in the public domain.


I had initially wanted to use a photo of the Main Hall of the old Cincinnati Library, which one can find all over the internet. But going to the source, I see that it's _not_ offered by the Public Library of Cincinnati under an open license. But you can follow [this link and see it there](https://www.flickr.com/photos/cincinnatipubliclibrary/3357891281).

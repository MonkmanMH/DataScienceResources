### Data

Statistics Canada, [Symmetric Input-Output Tables](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/en/catalogue/15-207-X) -- Tables 15-207-X

>_Description:_
The symmetric industry by industry input-output tables show inter-industry transactions, that is, all purchases of an industry from all other industries as well as expenditures on imports and the components of value added such as wages and gross operating surplus. Similarly, the symmetric final demand tables show all purchases by each final demand category from all industries as well as expenditures on imports. The symmetric input-output tables are analytically derived from the industry by product supply and use tables. The tables are available at the Detail level and at the Link 1997, Link 1961 and Summary aggregations.
